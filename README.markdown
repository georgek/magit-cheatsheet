Magit Cheatsheet
================

This magit cheatsheet is based off the orignal version by Daemian Mack
see http://daemianmack.com/magit-cheatsheet.html its a simple copy in
latex designed so that it can be printed out and stuck to your desk or
pinned up on the wall. 

I'm also going to expand on it over time and welcome any contributions
that people would like to offer.
